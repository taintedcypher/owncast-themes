# A custom theme for Owncast 0.1.1

I know we don't like Twitch. Ssssh! We don't! We prefer [Owncast](https://owncast.online)!

But what if you wanted a nice theme for the next version of Owncast, that kinda reminds you of Twitch?

Well you could use this theme!

## How to use

### Requirements
- Owncast 0.1.1
  
**Note:** A the time of writing, Owncast 0.1.1 has **not** been released yet. You could try using this theme on Owncast 0.1.0, but it'll probably break in all kind of painful ways!

### Installation

1. Copy the content of the `owncast-twitchy.css` file;
2. In your Owncast admin interface, navigate to "Configuration" > "General" then the "Appearance" tab;
3. Paste the content of the file into the text field under "Customize your page styling with CSS";
4. Click "Save" under the text field.

**Note:** You probably want to reset all Owncast colors to their default value, then only change the shades of purple, which are used throughout the custom theme on several elements.
